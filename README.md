# Animals-Project-Starter-Code

Instructions: Choose your favorite animal and write 10 facts about it. After, make up an adventure story about you and your animal.

Your webpage should eventually include:
* a page heading
* multiple paragraphs
* an image
* links (possibly)

After each edit, scroll down and click on the button that says Commit Changes.

We will use GitHub Pages to view your webpage once it is finished.
